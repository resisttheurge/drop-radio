# Open Art License version 1.0

This work is copyrighted by the author but available for re-distribution or re-use under these conditions:

- **Attribution**:
  The original credits must be incorporated verbatim into the artifact produced by the reuse. For example, the composer of a song with this restriction must be listed in the credits of a video if that song is used as its sound track.

- **Noncommercial**:
  The reuse is not for profit. For example, an audio file with this restriction could be used as the sound track for an educational video available for the cost of shipping and handling, but not as the soundtrack for a BMW commercial.

- **Registration**:
  A new user must notify the original community of that re-use. This notice may take many forms--including a message to an online forum or email list, or a comment on a blog--but ideally the notice should be accessible to an entire community. For example, a programmer who reuses a JavaScript from The Pool would need to add a reference to her derivative work back in The Pool.

- **View Source**:
  The source file/s for the work must remain accessible to the public. For example, a song created with a music editor like Fruityloops must be released in both its final (mp3) and source (.flp) formats. (The Combinations and Transformations rights dictate whether reuse includes the right to modify such source file/s.)

- **Sharealike Combinations**:
  Whatever license terms restrict the original artifact must restrict other works combined with it in the future. For example, if a composer makes her song freely available for noncommercial purposes, then a video incorporating that song must also be available under the same terms. Also called "copyleft".

- **Sharealike Transformations**:
  Whatever license terms restrict the original artifact must restrict reuses as well. For example, if a composer makes her song freely available for noncommercial purposes, then a remix of that song must also be available under the same terms. Also called "copyleft".

A copy of this copyright notice, or a link to http://three.org/openart/license/, should accompany any distribution of the work.

The work is offered as is, with no promises of fitness or liability implied.
